# Introduction
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web wirters.
Markdown allows you to write with easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format.
However, Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. 

# Syntax

## Overiew

## Block Elements

### Paragraphs and Line Breaks
Def: A paargraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, seperated by one or more blank lines.   
When you do want to insert a `<br />` break tag using Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.
