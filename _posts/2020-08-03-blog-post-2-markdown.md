# Introduction
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web wirters.
Markdown allows you to write with easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format.
However, Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags.

### Paragraphs and Line Breaks
Def: A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, seperated by one or more blank lines.   
When you do want to insert a `<br />` break tag using Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.

### Headers
Markdown supports two different styles of headers:   
Setext-style: use underlines (any number) of equal signs and dashes for first- and second-level headers respectively. For example,   
This is first-level header.
=== 
Thisi is second-level header.

atx-style: 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line corresponds to six levels of headers. For example:
# First-level header
## Second-level header
##### Fifth-level header

### Blockquotes
