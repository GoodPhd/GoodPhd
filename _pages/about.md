My name is Haibo Yang. I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jia(Kevin) Liu](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jialiu/).


Research Interests
------

My research mainly focuses on theoretical understanding of provable first-order stochastic optimization methods for deep learning. Inspired by the theoretical insight and fundamental understanding of these algorithms, I am interested in developing intelligent and efficient algorithms to better fit large-scale distributed system.

* First-order stochastic optimization algorithms.<br>
To develop provable first-order stochastic optimization algorithms for convex/non-convex problems.

* Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning.<br>
To develop secure machine learning algorithms.

* Robust Machine Learning.<br>
To develop secure machine learning algorithms.
