My name is Haibo Yang. I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jia(Kevin) Liu](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jialiu/).


Research Insterests
------

My research focuses on providing fundamental understandings of how distributed training algorithms are influenced by system-level variability in the computing infrastructure, and statistical variability in the training data. Inspired by the theoretical insights, I seek to design system- and data-aware distributed training algorithms that can seamless scale to a large number of computing nodes.
