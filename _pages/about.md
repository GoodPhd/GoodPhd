My name is Haibo Yang. I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jia(Kevin) Liu](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jialiu/).


Research Insterests
------

My research focuses on theoretical understanding of stochastic optimization algorithms for deep learning. Inspired by these theoretical insights, I am interested in designing intelligent and adaptive algorithms to better fit distributed systems and statistical heterogeneity. In addition, I am also insterested in develope communication efficient and robust algorithms in distributed/federated learning.

My research mainly focuses on theoretical understanding of provable first-order stochastic optimization methods for deep learning. Inspired by the theoretical insight and fundamental understanding of these algorithms, I am interested in developing intelligent and efficient algorithms to better fit distributed system and .
